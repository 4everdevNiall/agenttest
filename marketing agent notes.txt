Marketing Agent



Phase 1: Free & Flexible

Writing: Use free tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, or Perplexity.

Ask for outlines, draft paragraphs, or templates instead of full posts.

Example: “Make an outline for a blog titled ‘5 Ways AI Can Boost Marketing.’”

Social Media: Use the same tools to draft posts for LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.

Visuals: Use Canva (free) for graphics.

Polishing: Use Grammarly or Google Docs’ built-in checker.

Cost: $0 (just your time).





Phase 2: Integrated & Optimized

AI Writing Tools: Upgrade to Jasper, Copy.ai, or Writesonic ($20–50/month). They have ready-made templates and save time.

SEO Tools: Use Surfer SEO or Semrush for content that ranks. More costly, but boosts visibility.




Phase 3: Automated & Scalable

Social Media Management: Tools like Buffer or SocialBee create, schedule, and analyze posts ($5–50/month).

Case Studies: Use AI + your template. Input client info → AI produces polished case study + social posts

Phase 1 (Free & Flexible)
 
	Use Claude (free or via Cursor) to brainstorm, outline, and draft blog posts, case studies, and social posts.
 
	Claude is especially good at long-form, structured writing (like case study templates or detailed guides).
 
Phase 2 (Integrated & Optimized)
 
	Claude can act as your editing + refining layer on top of Jasper/Copy.ai outputs — e.g., “Make this LinkedIn post more engaging for marketing managers” or “Rewrite this case study for a C-suite audience.”
 
	You can also feed Claude SEO insights (from Surfer SEO or Semrush) and have it weave keywords naturally into the text.
 
Phase 3 (Automated & Scalable)
 
	Claude can help you build your “AI Agent” workflow:
 
	Input raw interview notes.
 
	Claude structures them into a case study.
 
	Claude then generates LinkedIn posts, tweet threads, or even email drafts from that case study.
 
	It can also summarize performance reports from tools like Buffer so you don’t have to parse all the data manually

. Collect data ✅

Already working: Form → Excel in OneDrive.

2. Prepare post text with Claude

In Excel, add a LinkedInPost column.

Copy reviews into Claude → “Rewrite this into a short LinkedIn post (≤280 chars, professional).”

Paste results into the LinkedInPost column.

3. Create your free LinkedIn App

Go to LinkedIn Developers
.

Click Create App.

Fill in:

App name (anything, e.g. FormToLinkedIn)

Your LinkedIn profile as the owner

Logo (can be a placeholder)

Once created → copy Client ID and Client Secret.

4. Get an Access Token

Request scopes: w_member_social (post as you).

Use LinkedIn’s OAuth 2.0 flow → it gives you an access token.

For quick demos: generate manually in the dev console → copy token.

5. Connect Excel to LinkedIn (via script)

Write a simple Python script that:

Reads your Excel file (column LinkedInPost).

Picks any row not yet posted.

Sends it to LinkedIn’s API:

import requests

ACCESS_TOKEN = "your_token_here"

post_text = "Customer says: Working with ETHOS was excellent 👏"

url = "https://api.linkedin.com/v2/ugcPosts"
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}",
    "X-Restli-Protocol-Version": "2.0.0",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
data = {
  "author": "urn:li:person:YOUR_PROFILE_ID",
  "lifecycleState": "PUBLISHED",
  "specificContent": {
    "com.linkedin.ugc.ShareContent": {
      "shareCommentary": {"text": post_text},
      "shareMediaCategory": "NONE"
    }
  },
  "visibility": {
    "com.linkedin.ugc.MemberNetworkVisibility": "PUBLIC"
  }
}
resp = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
print(resp.status_code, resp.text)


Run script → your text goes live on LinkedIn.

6. Track posted rows

Add a Posted? column in Excel.

After the script posts, mark that row as Yes.

✅ Result

Free workflow: Form → Excel → Claude → LinkedIn.

You control when/what gets posted.

Works on your profile without paying for API access.
